Goer - who knows how to redirect users to go to specific urls, in or out of the current domain.

It is an ideal script for use with QR Codes. It is also better if you want to use clean URLs for your common urls that can change in future.

It depends on php and Apache server. It works based on .htaccess, so you need a Apache server to make it work. I haven't tried nginx, lighttp or other servers, so I don't know how to adopt for them.

This script is released under GPL v2. So use it, share it, improve it, or whatever.

Edit the test.php to make it redirect, make a qr code or do whatever with the URL.
